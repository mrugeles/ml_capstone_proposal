## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

The "right of request"  is a legal mechanism  included in the Colombian Constitution of 1991 designed to allow efficient comunication between a citizen and the Goverment. This mechanism is one of the most fundamental democratic tools in Colombia as it allow all citizens, but most importanlty, the most vulnerable to ensure the Goverment is fulfilling his obligations with the people. Once a "right of request" is required by a citizen, the goverement has from 10 to 30 days to resolve the case.

This in practice, means that the Goverment needs to ensure it has the procedures and infrastructure to resolve a right of request as soon as posible.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

One of the basics rights of every citizen is the access to the health care system. Although Colombia faces big challenges to ensure access to the health care system for everyone, it's recognized as one of the best in LATAM (* refereces). The Goverment of Colombia has been creating online resources to allow citizens to raise complaints or ask for information in all ministeries and public entities, and it's expected that the volumen of "right of request" will increase as more citizens has access to the internet. The Ministry of Health receives all kinds of right of request and must find a way to decide which cases have more priority as many of these cases are about citizens with life at risk.

Deciding when a person's life is at risk may depend on both technical and legal grounds, and it require experts in the field (medicine and law) to make the right assesment. But the volumen of cases can eventually exceed experts's capacity to respond quickly with the right desition. 

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
