## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

One of the most active areas in astronomy is the discovery of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), it was not until the mid 90's that it was demostrated that there exists another planets orbiting another stars. From all techniques used by astronomers to discover exoplanets, the transit method is the one that have delivered most results. The transit method consist in observing the light from a star for long periods of time and measuring very small changes in the intensity of its light. Periodic changes in the intensity of the star's light can suggest the existence of a planet orbiting a star, as the planet dims the light of the star when it pases between the star and the telescope observing that star.

Knowing about another planetary systems help astronomers to test their theories about how planetary systems are form and could potentially help us to find out if there another planets similar to ours and with that, increasing the posibilities of finding life in other places on our own galaxy.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

Discovering exoplanets can produce large amounts of information from which astronomers will look for specific features in the data to decide if a planet has a planet orbiting arount it. This requires statistics aproachs to make sense of the data an make a suitable project for a Supervised Learning project to build a classification model to identify planets in a start by using the transit method.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
